Three metrics are used in our work. For datasets without 3D ground truth, we used 
[official MS COCO metrics](https://cocodataset.org/#keypoints-eval) to evaluate reprojection error. For datasets with 3D ground truth, we used [Percentage of Correct Parts(PCP)](https://github.com/zju3dv/mvpose) and Mean Per Joint Position Error (MPJPE) for evaluation.

### Acknowledgement
MS COCO for the metric of 2D keypoint, and Repo of [MVPOSE](https://github.com/zju3dv/mvpose) for PCP metric.
